# BitStrap

This is BitCake's set of useful tools that will let you quickly bootstrap a new Unity project.
We use it in our projects and hope it will be of help for yours! :)

## What is this project for?

This is our humble way to give back to the gamedev community.
We hope this will ease other people lives when working with Unity.

You are free to use these tools in whatever project you're doing. Make us proud! :D

## Getting started

Easy! Since this is a Unity project, just download it and then continue from there.
Alternatively, you can add all assets inside `Assets/BitStrap` to an already existing Unity project.

It is also possible to import it directly from the [AssetStore](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51416).

## Documentation

NOTE: Right now we're moving all the documentation to this repository [Wiki](https://github.com/bitcake/bitstrap/wiki)!

Although all the classes are already documented, we also have a simple web page
containing a feature list followed by a quick explanation of each. You can think
of it as a "table of contents".
